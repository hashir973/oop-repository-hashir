## Project Description ##
Tappy bird is a game in which a player controls a bird’s flight height to avoid obstacles. Pressing the key for a longer period of time allows the bird to fly higher, while letting go causes the bird to fly lower. This project will bring the game to life using a video camera to detect a player’s motion, and controls the bird based on the speed at which a player flaps her arms. The FPGA will render an image of the bird flying through an environment, and display the flapping motion of the wings according to the player’s speed.

##How to Run##
- enter into flappy bord folder
- then assets folder
- then scene folder
- double click into play unity file
- after playing from unity just click on the game IDE and the game will start
